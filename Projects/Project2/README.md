Time: 4 hours
What it does:
Creates a double queue that can insert elements from the front and back of the queue. Everything compiles and runs perfectly fine. This will work for anything. The one thing I could have improved was the Pop_Back() function. This does not run in constant time as indicated by the while loop. I could have made this run better by keeping track of the back previous node.
Besides that, this project went smoothly and shows my knowledge on deques and doubly linked lists.
